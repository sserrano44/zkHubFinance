# elhub Technical Specification

Version: `0.1.0`  
Last updated: `2026-02-21`

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines the technical specification for elhub, a hub-and-spoke, intent-based, cross-chain money market.

Core goals:
1. Concentrate accounting and liquidity on Base (hub).
2. Allow user entry/exit on Worldchain (spoke).
3. Require hub-side pre-locking for borrow/withdraw safety.
4. Finalize all cross-chain accounting through batch settlement.
5. Support production ZK verifier mode without changing settlement interface.

In-scope components:
1. Solidity contracts under `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/contracts/src`.
2. Relayer, indexer, prover services under `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/services`.
3. Circuit and proving artifacts under `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/circuits`.
4. E2E/testing flows in `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/scripts` and `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/contracts/test`.

## 2. Topology and Chains

### 2.1 Network roles
1. Hub chain: Base (source of truth for all accounting, risk, and liquidity).
2. Spoke chain: Worldchain (escrow/fill execution and event emission).

### 2.2 Default local/fork wiring
1. Hub RPC default: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
2. Spoke RPC local default: `http://127.0.0.1:9545`
3. Spoke RPC fork E2E default: `http://127.0.0.1:8546`
4. Hub chain ID default: `8453`
5. Spoke chain ID default: `480`

## 3. Assets and Registry Model

Initial assets:
1. `WETH` (18 decimals)
2. `USDC` (6 decimals)
3. `wARS` (18 decimals default)
4. `wBRL` (18 decimals default)

4. Borrow proof backend enforces source receiver allowlist and source finality + source event inclusion checks.
5. `HubSettlement` accepts proof-verified borrow fill evidence via `PROOF_FILL_ROLE`.

## 6. Intent and Lifecycle State Machines

### 6.1 Supply/Repay (Worldchain -> Base)
1. User calls `SpokePortal.initiateSupply` or `initiateRepay`.
2. Spoke portal escrows funds and calls Across transport (`AcrossBridgeAdapter -> depositV3`).
3. Relayer observes source Across deposit event and records `initiated`.
4. Across destination fill calls `HubAcrossReceiver.handleV3AcrossMessage`:
   1. receiver records `pending_fill` only (no custody credit).
5. Relayer observes hub `PendingDepositRecorded`, requests proof from prover, then calls `finalizePendingDeposit`.
6. On valid proof:
   1. receiver transfers bridged token to `HubCustody`.
   2. receiver calls `HubCustody.registerBridgedDeposit`.
   3. indexer status updates to `bridged`.
7. Prover enqueues action.
8. Settlement batch verifies and applies supply/repay accounting.

### 6.2 Borrow (Base accounting -> Worldchain payout via Across)
1. User signs EIP-712 intent.
2. Relayer calls `HubLockManager.lock`.
3. Relayer calls `HubAcrossBorrowDispatcher.dispatchBorrowFill`.
4. Across destination fill calls `SpokeAcrossBorrowReceiver.handleV3AcrossMessage`:
   1. receiver pays recipient and relayer fee.
   2. receiver emits `BorrowFillRecorded`.
5. Relayer observes `BorrowFillRecorded`, requests proof from prover, and calls `HubAcrossBorrowFinalizer.finalizeBorrowFill`.
6. Finalizer verifies proof and records fill evidence into settlement.
7. Prover batches finalize action.
8. Settlement consumes lock, updates hub accounting, reimburses relayer.

### 6.3 Withdraw (Base accounting -> Worldchain payout)
1. User signs EIP-712 intent.
2. Relayer calls `HubLockManager.lock`.
3. Relayer fills withdraw directly on spoke (`SpokePortal.fillWithdraw`).
4. Relayer records fill evidence in settlement.
5. Prover batches finalize action.
6. Settlement consumes lock, updates hub accounting, reimburses relayer.

### 6.4 Indexer intent statuses
1. `initiated`
2. `pending_lock`
3. `locked`
4. `filled`
5. `awaiting_settlement`
6. `settled`
7. `failed`

### 6.5 Indexer deposit statuses
1. `initiated`
2. `pending_fill`
3. `bridged`
4. `settled`

## 7. Proof System Specification

### 7.1 Field and hash
Constants:
1. `SNARK_SCALAR_FIELD = 21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617`
2. `HASH_BETA = 1315423911`
3. `HASH_C = 11400714819323198485`

`hashPair(left,right)`:
1. `t = (left + right*BETA + C) mod field`
2. output = `t^5 mod field`

### 7.2 actionsRoot derivation
For a batch:
1. Start with `hashPair(batchId, hubChainId)`.
2. Fold `spokeChainId`.
3. Fold total action count.
4. Fold each action hash in deterministic order:
   1. all supply credits
   2. all repay credits
   3. all borrow finalizations
   4. all withdraw finalizations
5. Right-pad with zero action hashes until 50 actions.
6. Final state serialized as `bytes32` root.

### 7.3 Public inputs
Current public inputs passed on-chain:
1. `batchId` (field reduced)
2. `hubChainId` (field reduced)
3. `spokeChainId` (field reduced)
4. `actionsRoot` (field reduced)

### 7.4 Circuit
File: `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/circuits/circom/SettlementBatchRoot.circom`

Public signals:
1. `batchId`
2. `hubChainId`
3. `spokeChainId`
4. `actionsRoot`

Private witness:
1. `actionCount`
2. `actionIds[50]` (padded)

Current limitation:
1. Circuit proves deterministic root consistency, not full bridge/lock/fill validity constraints.

## 8. Off-Chain Service Specifications

### 8.1 Relayer service
File: `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/services/relayer/src/server.ts`

Public endpoints:
1. `GET /health`
2. `GET /quote?intentType=<n>&amount=<uint>`
3. `POST /intent/submit`

Behavior:
1. Watches spoke Across `V3FundsDeposited` logs.
2. Updates indexer via signed internal calls.
3. Waits for hub-side Across callback (`PendingDepositRecorded`), then runs permissionless proof finalization for inbound deposits.
4. For borrow submit:
   1. lock on hub
   2. dispatch Across fill from hub via `HubAcrossBorrowDispatcher`
   3. observe spoke `BorrowFillRecorded`
   4. finalize proof on hub via `HubAcrossBorrowFinalizer`
   5. enqueue prover action
5. For withdraw submit:
   1. lock on hub
   2. fill on spoke (`SpokePortal.fillWithdraw`)
   3. record fill evidence on hub settlement
   4. enqueue prover action

Internal endpoints:
1. `POST /internal/enqueue`
2. `POST /internal/flush`

Modes:
1. `PROVER_MODE=dev`: deterministic dev proof.
2. `PROVER_MODE=circuit`: executes `snarkjs groth16 fullprove`.

Queue behavior:
1. Dedup on action key.
2. Dequeue only after settlement tx receipt.
3. Persists queue and `nextBatchId` in JSON files.

### 8.4 Internal API authentication
Used by relayer/prover/indexer.

Headers:
1. `x-elhub-internal-ts`
2. `x-elhub-internal-sig`

Signature payload:
1. `METHOD + "\n" + ROUTE_PATH + "\n" + TIMESTAMP + "\n" + SHA256(rawBody)`
2. HMAC-SHA256 using `INTERNAL_API_AUTH_SECRET`.

Additional controls:
1. Timestamp skew window.
2. Replay cache.
3. Route-level rate limiting.

## 9. Deployment Specification

Primary script:
1. `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/contracts/script/deploy-local.mjs`

Outputs:
1. `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/contracts/deployments/local.json`
2. `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/contracts/deployments/local.env`
3. `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/apps/web/public/deployments/local.json`

Verifier deployment modes:
1. `HUB_VERIFIER_DEV_MODE=1`:
   1. Deploys `Verifier` in dev mode.
2. `HUB_VERIFIER_DEV_MODE=0`:
   1. Requires `HUB_GROTH16_VERIFIER_ADDRESS`.
   2. Deploys `Groth16VerifierAdapter`.
   3. Deploys `Verifier` in prod mode pointing to adapter.

## 10. E2E and Test Specifications

### 10.1 Contract test suites
Location: `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/contracts/test`

Coverage includes:
1. Interest and share-accounting invariants.
2. Lock HF checks and reservation concurrency.
3. Settlement replay/failure/atomicity.
4. Liquidation behavior.
5. Base fork supply/borrow lifecycle.
6. Cross-chain fork lock/Across-dispatch/proof-finalize/settle path.
7. Across receiver pending-fill/proof-finalization invariants.
8. Production verifier path rejecting tampered proofs.

### 10.2 Scripted fork E2E (dev proof)
Script:
1. `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/scripts/e2e-fork.mjs`

Command:
1. `pnpm test:e2e:fork`

RPC resolution order:
1. process env (`HUB_RPC_URL`, `SPOKE_NETWORK`, `SPOKE_<NETWORK>_RPC_URL`)
2. `.env` with the same keys
3. localhost defaults (`8545/8546`) for local worldchain flow

### 10.3 Base -> Mainnet-Hub supply-only E2E
Script:
1. `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/scripts/e2e-base-mainnet-supply.mjs`

Command:
1. `pnpm test:e2e:base-mainnet-supply`

Checks:
1. deposit reaches `pending_fill`
2. deposit transitions to `bridged` only after proof finalization
3. settlement credits user supply on hub

### 10.4 Active E2E command set
Commands:
1. `pnpm test:e2e:base-mainnet-supply` (supply-only inbound lifecycle)
2. `pnpm test:e2e:fork` (full supply + borrow lifecycle)
3. `pnpm test:e2e` (runs both active E2E commands)

Note:
1. Circuit-mode E2E wrappers were removed because deposit proof generation is not yet circuit-compatible end-to-end for the new pending-fill finalization path.

## 11. Security and Safety Requirements

Enforced in current implementation:
1. Hub-side lock required before borrow/withdraw finalization.
2. Lock relayer binding and expiry checks.
3. Double-fill prevention on spoke.
4. Batch/intent/deposit replay protections in settlement.
5. Settlement applies only after verifier success.
6. Reentrancy guards on critical state transition functions.
7. Pause controls on lock manager, settlement, market, and spoke portal.

Known security gaps (tracked by readiness plan):
1. Deposit proof backend trust/quality (production must use real light-client/ZK verification constraints for source event validity).
2. Production DB/idempotent outbox model for services (P0-4).
3. Full validity constraints in ZK circuit (remaining P0-1 work).
4. Governance hardening, oracle hardening, and audit closure (P1/P2).

## 12. Open Work to Reach Production-Ready

The remaining blockers are:
1. Complete P0-1 circuit constraints:
   1. prove deposit attestation validity
   2. prove lock/fill matching validity
   3. prove amount/fee constraint validity
2. Ship production deposit proof backend (light-client/ZK) with full source-event validity constraints.
3. Complete P0-4 durable persistence migration from JSON to transactional DB + outbox.
4. Execute P1 and P2 workstreams as defined in `/Users/sebas/projects/elhub/PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md`.
